- Numerically and analytically investigating random walks on various simple two-dimensional
manifolds
- Optimizing programs in Mathematica to perform these random walks and collect data on
their outcomes
- Interpreting this data collection as a numerical solution to $u \Delta = -1 $ on the chosen manifold
