Growing up in Minnesota, I always had a passion for seeking new knowledge. I quickly applied that passion to physics where I thoroughly enjoy reading, writing, talking, and learning about physics and mathematics. Currently, I am working on the proposed Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) doing feasibility studies and software development for the experimentâ€™s analytical framework.
